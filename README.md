SnakeOil is a Python API for interacting with the Transmission BitTorrent Daemon on Linux. It uses the RPC endpoints for communication, so it should work on most distros, but so far it has only been tested on Ubuntu 14.

##Requirements##

 * requests >= 2.4.1
 * nose >= 1.3.3 (Only if you want to run tests)
 * mock >= 1.0.3
